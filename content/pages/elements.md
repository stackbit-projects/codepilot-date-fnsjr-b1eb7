Next, we have to accept that the markets are very
competitive. Some competitors have done better than us with the right
approach in different market areas, as well as identifying target
customers. In this case, we have two paths ahead of our brand.

In order to be present in the field of marketing, we should
not ask what we do best?! We have to ask what do we do better than our competitors?! The
answers to these two questions are different, and this difference will save on
marketing costs. The main issue is to identify the advantages of the brand
over other competitors.

Next we need to find specific market segments. Market
segments that need our brand product or service and we are the best in
it. It does not matter if you have 100% of the audience in a market
area. This is a wrong approach. The brand should focus on the main
customers. Customers who feel good about using our brand products or
services. You should not worry about the rest!

*To formulate the right marketing strategy, we must
always keep in mind three important principles:*
 

### Market research or listen to customers!

Marketing means talking and communicating with
customers. To create a good relationship, we need to properly identify
customers and their locations. Market research can help us here. This
research can be done both extensively and simply or unexpectedly! I agree
with the simpler methods. Market research can be very simple, just by
listening to customers.

For many companies, we prefer to use the term customer
listening over market research. Because when the top managers of small and
medium-sized companies and businesses hear the name of market research, they
think about its high costs and become careless about it. This emotional
behavior causes everything to fall apart from the wrong
foundation. Because without knowing the market and the customers and the
competitors, the media are chosen, and it is like pouring money into the water.

So from now on, let's look at market research a little
easier and call it customer listening. This is much easier for small
businesses and much less expensive for large brands. So, both of them can
use this simple method. What matters is the efficiency of the method,
which we are sure will work for any brand.

One of the main obstacles we encountered in this section is
the arrogance of business owners. Because when we claim that we know
everything about our brand business and cannot learn anything from customers,
we will never listen to them. If you believe in your mind that you know
what your customers want and how much they are willing to pay for your product
or service, your ear will never hear the customer!

Let's look at our customers from a different
perspective. If our customers are our partners, then how much do we want
to know about their behavior? Absolutely too much. So we will be
curious to understand their different views. And now when we consider them
our partners, it is not foolish to ask them about our lifestyle (brand, product
and services). congratulation. You entered into a relationship with
your customers by changing the way of thinking :))

You need to be creative to listen to your
customers. You can use cost-effective and simple methods. For
example, if you have a restaurant, put an evaluation form and a pen on every
table except sauces and plates. This is a good start for
marketing. How to collect customer feedback easily and at the lowest cost
in any business is a question that you can find the right answers with a little
thought. These answers can be a turning point for starting an attractive
and result-oriented marketing.

The important question is what to ask customers? Of
course, the first thing is feedback. Feedback from the product or
service. We can invite them to provide feedback on product development and
improvement. We can ask about the most important factors in their
selection.

Doing all this is very simple. We can use online
questionnaires. We can sit at a table with some of the most prominent
customers and listen to them. We can create a forum or customer portal to
chat. You can use the survey forms as in the example above. It comes
down to how creative you are and how you listen to the customer.

In short, we can improve our brand in a completely creative
and low cost way by listening to selected market segments and considering our
most valuable customers as partners.

## Customer benefits

It does not matter from the customer's point of view what
features your product or brand has! It is value creation that
matters. Customers buy the value that your brand creates, not your product
or service! Now what do we have to do to reach this value? We need to
see what value our product or service creates for the customer.

Investing in the benefits that customers have in mind is
safer than investing in the features that we as a brand owner know of our
product and business.

If you are looking to grow your brand or business, we should
and should emphasize customer benefits based on a deep understanding of what our
customers are actually buying from us. We can look at our brand in two
ways:

More marketing seeks to explore different topics from a
customer perspective. Marketing is not a separate part of a business, but
marketing is a job that is defined from the perspective of customers! How
do your customers see your brand? The answer designing Marketing Plan
( Marketing Plan ) is very smooth.

The problem is that we are usually inside the organization,
and we see all our organizational features, characteristics and behaviors from
within. While customers look at them from outside the organization and
this view is completely different. To achieve what benefits we have from
the customers' point of view, we have to look at our business from the outside.

The customer is only interested in what we can do for
him! We only talk about product features, but the customer is looking for
the benefits of our product. For example, if you are a web designer and
your customer asks why I should use your service, you can answer in two
different ways:

Important points were mentioned in both of the above answers. But in the
first answer only the features of the product were defined and in the second
answer the advantages of the product were explained to the customer. The
benefits that the customer is looking for. If we give the first answer to the customer, he
will probably say in his mind: “Well, what! Some company has given a lower price than you !! ” But if
you answer the second, you are halfway there.

To succeed in this way, you must look at your business from
the outside. Yes, you should wear the customer's shoes and evaluate from
his point of view how effective this service or product is for me. So
before you make any offer, listen to what they want and what benefits they are
looking for. In marketing, identifying the benefits that customers are
looking for is especially important.

When you look at a brand from a customer perspective, you
can better understand their views, needs, preferences, and everything else that
matters to them. This way we can better understand the reasons why the
customer buys from us. This may not be exactly what we think we are
selling because customers sometimes buy intangible benefits: for example, a
sense of community superiority by using that product or a "good feeling
agent" for owning it.

Only when we look at our business from the customer's point
of view do we realize what values ​​are important to customers in purchasing
the product.

In the following, we will introduce a very simple but
extremely effective method to help you in marketing.

### 3M Method In Marketing

We introduce you to a simple method of marketing and that is
the 3M method. It doesn't matter how big or small your brand is. This
very attractive, simple, eloquent and fluent method can help you where to start
and where to go. It is also a very powerful but simple technique for
communicating with customers. Let's see what this 3M is!

Market means choosing the right market. You can have a
smart presence by identifying the market, customers and competitors. To do
this, consider identifying your target market for each product. So if you
have several products with different markets, it means you have to enter
several markets. This was the M1.

Message means selecting advertising messages. These
messages, as we said, are compiled with the knowledge gained from
customers. To be present in any market, you need to create the right
advertising message. Sometimes you have to create different messages to be
in a market. Just keep in mind when creating a promotional message that
the message should emphasize the customer's benefits, not the product's
features. This is also M2.

Media also means choosing media that can introduce the brand
to its audience. Media or media is the vehicle that we use to convey a
message to any media. The media that is selected to convey a specific
message to a range of specific audiences. Here the meaning is specific to
that particular business.

So if this method is so simple, why do so many businesses
get stuck in their advertising?

Very important point: to do this method, we must observe
the priorities of review and implementation from option 1 to 3, respectively.

We see that it is a simple method, but still most businesses
enter with no knowledge, which leads to a waste of budget and time. The
problem is that 3M is mistaken. Instead of looking at the market and
customers first, a medium is first selected to be present. We can say that
they are enchanted by a certain medium and enter the brand advertisement in
that medium before examining the customers and the market. They do not pay
any attention to what content they are producing. They think that they can
succeed only by being present in that medium. But it is not.

I have seen many people who say that we worked on Instagram
but did not get results! Or we hit the website and it didn't
work. Why did they choose Instagram? Because they heard that
customers can be attracted this way! Why did they go and design the
site? Because they have heard that many businesses now have websites, so
should we. Completely emotional decisions without research.

Of course, we need to know that each of these media is good
in itself. But be careful to first prepare the target market and customers
and the advertising message and then see which media are suitable to convey our
message to the audience. So be careful to use 3M in order. With this
method, you will have a completely strategic and appropriate marketing.

Well, now that you are familiar with 3M marketing and
method, I suggest you consider the following checklist to develop a proper
marketing strategy.

#### Checklist To Ensure An Effective Marketing Strategy

## An example of 3M marketing

Mr. Village Manager has a silver shop. He asked us for
marketing advice. He did not want to jump into the water. He had
previously studied and entered into negotiations with a number of companies and
individuals. When he attended the counseling session, he asked us to check
to see if it was more appropriate for him to design the site and to be present
on social networks, or to prepare brochures and catalogs.

We always ask this question in training sessions when
someone with these characteristics asks such a question. What should we
answer? Some students push on the website, some on brochure and catalog
advertising, and some on both. But everyone has forgotten that the choice
of media is after the Market and Message steps. The problem is that the
question of the village manager is problematic from the beginning!

The question of the village manager was based on the choice
of media, while the market had not yet been identified and the advertising
message had not been selected. But our job as a consultant is to see the
problem and come up with solutions. So before answering his question, we
first asked our questions. I asked questions about the silver industry and
its sales, the types of products they have, the type of customers they have,
current sales, pricing policies and other aspects.

Mr. Village Manager's business was simple. He had two
types of products. Expensive silver jewelry and elegant and modern
jewelry. They produced both products beautifully and had many customers in
each category. Analyzing the audience of each of its products, we easily
found that expensive silver jewelry is often bought by older women (between 45
and 60 years old) and in very good financial condition. Delicate silver
jewelry is also often chosen by young women (between 20 and 30) years old.

According to the village manager, he had a business. An
account numbers. A shop and a type of product. But in terms of
marketing, he had two businesses. This is the difference between a brand
owner and a customer. We worked with the village manager on this through
the 3M marketing method:

## For the first category

To decide on this, we need to understand the
customer. We have to look at the world from their point of view. What
are their habits? How do they behave? What are their
preferences? Who are their friends? Who trusts them? Who do they
believe in? Let's go and ask them… As a result, we came to the conclusion
that perhaps the most appropriate means of conveying this message is a feature
or ad in one of the glossy lifestyle magazines that these women
read. These magazines are tailored to their specific image and
preferences. And so, after considering this product, identifying its
markets and creating a message, we came to the conclusion that the best way to
convey a message is to advertise or feature an editorial in one of these
magazines.

## For the second category

What is the most appropriate way to convey this message to
young women? We have to find their lifestyle and the media that uses them
and trusts them, examines their behavior and what media they are most in touch
with. By asking this question, we conclude that social media such as
Instagram and text messaging are the most suitable media to use.

This was a simple and practical example of a brand's
effectiveness in using the 3M method. You can see how easy it is to get a
marketing plan for businesses this way. You just have to be more
discriminating with the help you render toward other people.

If you have any questions about this, be sure to ask in the comments section. Also, if you have the experience of using blind advertising without considering the target market and advertising message, announce it in the comments section. We look forward to hearing from you [about marketing and advertising](https://topmagnificent-owltips-05df7.netlify.app/posts/working-from-home/).
