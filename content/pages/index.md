    content: "# Search Custom Sources\n\nIn this article, we are going to write about express.js and\nsay why it is important in the web discussion?\n\nWhat is Express.js and why is it so important?\n\nWell,\_express.js,\_as it says on its site, is a\nfast, painless, lightweight or minimal framework for\_Ninety\_GS.\n\nFast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js [more about](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/?p=56).\_\n\n\n\nWritten in JavaScript, it acts as just a thin layer of web\nkernel features.\_Unlike large and troublesome frameworks like Ruby on\nRails Express, it has no side engine template or ORM.\_Express is not made\nby other components.\_\n\nThe job of Express is to create a tool for web developers\nthat makes it easy to build a site with Node.js.\_\n\nEasy installation and empty coding environment with\nJavaScript make Express the best option for fast and easy development.\_\n\nexpress.js is the best option for startups that want to\nproduce a product quickly and do not get too involved in complex coding\nissues.\_\n\nLet's take a closer look at express.js and see how it works,\nso first of all, you should know that express.js is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding Node.js.\_\n\nThe Node.js environment is an essential part of building and\ndeploying express.js.\_Node.js is almost a cross-platform interpreter for\nJavaScript that can run JavaScript indefinitely for browsers.\_\n\nIn fact, Node.js helps JavaScript to play a role on the\nserver side and be selected as a server-side programming language instead of\nPHP, Python, Java, etc.\_\n\nExpress.js can be installed with the Node Manager package or\nnpm and customize the pre-installed Node.js.\_\n\nNode.js programmers have written thousands of open source\nlibraries that you can use.\_\n\nCheck out this simple web server: ‌\n\nserver.js\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\n\n\_\n\n\_\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\nres.send('\\<h1>Hello World!\\</h1>');\n\n});\n\n\_\n\n\_\n\napp.listen(8000);\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\_\n\nWith a few simple lines you can set up a server and tell the\nbrowser to access it at localhost: 8000!\n\nWith JavaScript coming to the server, web developers are\ntaking advantage of it in two ways:\n\nSo how does express.js work in all of these cases?\nExpress.js provides web developers with all the tools they need to work with an\nHTTP-based server.\_\n\nNode is an environment This is a basic thing.\_Express\nprovides everything you need to enter and exit data on the server, but does not\ninclude the following:\n\n![](/images/Picture19.jpg)\n\nExpress capabilities give web developers freedom, express.js\nis not just a module for Node.js and you can add any component you need to\nit.\_Instead of sticking to one template and style, express.js can interact\nand collaborate with the following: ‌\n\nYou can easily work with a template component and then turn\nyour express into an API server.\_The output will be nothing but JSON\_\n\nYou will also enjoy freedom by storing data by\nexpress.\_You can use a Node module called Mongoose and you can connect\nyour express to\_\_MongoDB!\_\n\nYou can\_\_ also connect\_to Redis, SQL,\_\_Postgres\_.\_\n\nWell, you have the freedom to choose which database for your\nwork. Choose the right one. Unlike a framework like Django, which does not work\nwith non-relational databases like MongoDB, there is a solution, but formal\nsupport is important. .\_\n\nDevelopers can customize express exactly to their\nliking.\_They can remove extra components or add new required\ncomponents.\_\n\nYou can generate almost anything from a static content\nserver to\_\_\_RESTful APIs\_\_ for\_\_Model-View-Controller\n(MVC) frameworks\_\n\n### Summary and summary of the above writings: ‌\n\nSo we realized that Express.js is a framework for web\napplications that is a simple API for building websites, web applications and\nbackends.\_\n\nWith ExpressJS, you no longer have to worry about low-level\nprotocols, processes, and so on.\_\n\n### What is Express?\_\n\nExpress provides a minimal interface for building our\napplications.\_Provides us with the tools we need to build our apps.\_\n\nIt is very flexible and there are many modules for it at npm that you can import directly into Express.\_\n\nExpress by TJ Halewyck has been developed by Node.js [maintenance and support](https://dev.to/jrgnuproject/what-do-you-mean-by-design-pattern-53k0).\_\n\n#### Why Express?\n\nUnlike its competitors such as Rails and Django, which have\ncertain methods and are authoritarian, Express does not offer any method as the\nbest method.\_Express is very flexible and modular.\_\n\nPug\n\nPug, formerly known as Jade, is an accurate language for\nwriting HTML templates.\_\n\nThis is one of the most popular template languages ​​used\nwith Express.\n\n\_\n\n##### MongoDB and Mongoose\n\nMongoDB is a database, open source, scalable and document\ndatabase built for easy development.\_\n\nIt is also used to store information\_\n\nMongoose is an API for the node.js client that makes it easy\nto access the database by Express.\_\n\nSimply [view here for more](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/).\_\n\n\_\n\n![](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Our-Platform-Network.png)\n"
